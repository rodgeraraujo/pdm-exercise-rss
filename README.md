### Query data xml, from the news [feed](https://www.diariodosertao.com.br/feed/atom) of the [Diário do Sertão](https://www.diariodosertao.com.br/) website

#### Requirements:

- Create an application that searches every 5 minutes for news in Diário do Sertão and lists them in the view;
- If a new query is different from the previous one, the user must be notified (in the tray);
- Queries should be stored in memory, but may persist in SQLite (if they feel comfortable).
